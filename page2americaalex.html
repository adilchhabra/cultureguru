	<h2>
	<strong>Dining</strong>
	</h2>

  	<li>
  		Putting one’s elbows on the table during a meal is considered rude.
	</li>

	<li>
		Americans try to avoid making unnecessary noise when eating, i.e. slurping or smacking. It is bad table manners to chew with your mouth open.
	</li>
	
	<li>Toothpicks are not to be used at the table. </li>

	<li>It is customary (although not technically required) to tip 15-20% for a waiter or waitress.</li>

	<li>If you have food leftover at a restaurant it is normal to ask for a take-home bag. </li>

	<li>
	It is normal to eat anywhere (the movies, the bus, the bathroom) and at any time of day.
	</li>

	<li>
	It is not customary to stay at a restaurant table for extended periods of time. Waiters tend to bring the bill right away in order to open the table up.
	</li>

	<li>
	Water is free in all restaurants.
	</li>

	<li>
	At most restaurants, you must wait to be seated by a host or hostess.
	</li>

	<h2>
	<strong>General Do's and Dont's</strong>
	</h2>

	<li>
	Lateness is considered rude. It is customary to call the person you are meeting if you are running late.
	</li>

	<li>
	Body odor is strongly looked down on. Almost everyone takes daily showers and uses underarm 
	deodorant.
	</li>

	<li>
	Cars must drive on the right side of the road. Foot traffic loosely follows this rule as well.
	</li>

	<li>
	Personal space is highly valued. Do not stand very close to someone when talking and do not touch someone you do not know other than a handshake.
	</li>

	<li>
	Do not touch or play with other people’s children without the consent of their parents (you may risk getting arrested).
	</li>

	<li>
	Men remove their hats when entering a building, while women may or may not.
	</li>

	<li>
	Customs that give special attention to women, such as getting up when a woman comes to the table or holding a door open are considered slightly old-fashioned. Older women tend to expect these customs to be observed, while younger women view them as unnecessary or even insulting.
	</li>

	<li>
	Work is considered noble, and therefore those who work hard but do not get paid as much are given respect.
	</li>

	<li>
	Smoking is not generally accepted indoors or in parks – you must check to see if smoking is permissible before doing so.
	</li>

	<li>
	B.Y.O.B. – Bring Your Own Bottle. Used to describe parties where alcohol will not be provided to the masses.
	</li>

	<li>
	Superstores like Walmart and Target are common. When running errands, Americans need only go to one store to get everything they need because of the immense range of items these stores sell.
	</li>

	<li>
	Price tags give the price of the item before tax is added.
	</li>

	<li>
	The drinking age is 21; the smoking age is 18.
	</li>

	<li>
	Jaywalking is illegal, although almost never enforced. However, it is more dangerous to cross a road where there is no crosswalk or when it is not your light, as drivers do not expect people to disobey traffic laws.
	</li>	

	

	<li>
	Customer-service is highly valued, and therefore if you are not happy with your product or service, demanding something better is encouraged.
	</li>

	<li>
	Americans are sensitive to political correctness, and therefore it is best to avoid controversial topics such as guns, politics, or religion.
	</li>
