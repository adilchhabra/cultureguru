  	<h2>
	Greeting
	</h2>
		<li>
			<strong>Address grownups</strong> by an honorific title (family relationship or e.g. teacher (laoshi) or by the family name plus Mr. (xiansheng), Ms. (nvshi) &#xA0;
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>A handshake</strong> is the most common form of non-verbal greeting, or just a nod, though neither is necessary.
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>The oldest person</strong> is always greeted first as a sign of respect.
		</li>

	<h2>
		Table Manners
	</h2>

		<li>
			<strong>When drinking a toast</strong> &#x2013; tap the table twice, and stand up if it&apos;s more formal.
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>At a banquet</strong> or on formal occasions, it&#x2019;s polite to sample all the dishes, and at the end of the meal you should leave a little on the plate to demonstrate the generosity of the host.
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>Bones and other inedibles:</strong>&#xA0;Do not put spit bones in your bowl or elsewhere. Use a tissue or hand to place them in the small plate provided &#x2014; or observe how others deal with them.
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>Chopsticks:</strong> Under no circumstances should chopsticks be placed upright in your bowl. This symbolizes death. Nor should you tap your bowl with chopsticks.&#xA0;
		</li>

	<h2>
		Giving and Receiving Gifts
	</h2>

		<li>
			Present and receive things with <strong>both hands</strong>.
		</li>

		<li>
			Chinese people usually <strong>do not unwrap gifts</strong> when receiving them. It is considered polite in Chinese culture to open the gifts after you leave. When you receive a gift from Chinese people, do not open them unless they insist, or you may simply ask, &quot;Can I open it?&quot;
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>When wrapping gifts</strong>, avoid using white or black wrapping paper, and avoid wrapping elaborately. Consider red or other festive colors.
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>Even numbers</strong> are considered good luck, with number four being the exception. It is appropriate to send one gift or send them in pairs.
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>It is inappropriate</strong> to send a clock or things to do with four as a gift, because they associate with funeral and death. Scissors or sharp things are not proper either, since they symbolize severing relations.
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>Small items</strong> like books, music CDs, perfumes, cigarettes and candies from your country are always well received.
		</li>
	<h2>
		General Do&apos;s and Don&apos;ts
	</h2>

		<li>
			Chinese people are just as proud of their country as visitors are of theirs, and probably more so. They can get a little irritated when customers favor them with <strong>criticisms of China</strong>. They know that things are not perfect, and they also know that they, like other countries, are working hard to deal with problems of environment and population and so on. Discussions regarding politics, state leaders, recent history, and issues about Taiwan, Xinjiang and Tibet are still seen as sensitive.
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>Do not overreact</strong> when asked personal questions regarding marital status, family, age, job or income, because this is done to seek common ground.
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>Keep calm</strong> when dealing with government officials if tense situations arise. Raising your voice or getting angry will help with nothing but creating a losing-face situation for all.
		</li>

		<li>
			Never write things in <strong>red ink</strong>. It symbolizes protest or severe criticism.
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>Punctuality</strong> is considered a virtue in China (though on average Chinese are 10 minutes late for engagements). Being on time shows respect for others. Chinese people show up a bit earlier to show their earnestness. Being on time for your tour or at any other time shows respect for the guide, and for fellow travelers
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>Public displays of affection</strong> are frowned upon.&#xA0;Do not back slap, hug or put your arm around someone&#x2019;s shoulder, which will make a Chinese feel uncomfortable, since they do not like to be touched by strangers. Of course you can do so if you are familiar with each other.
		</li>
</ul>
