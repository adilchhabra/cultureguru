  	<h2>

	Greeting

	</h2>

		<li>

			Indians hold their palms together and say <strong>'Namasteâ€™ (nuh-mus-tay)</strong> while greeting each other. Hugging and kissing on the cheeks, especially with the opposite sex is frowned upon and should be avoided.

		</li>



		<li>

			Another common gesture is <strong>the infamous bobbing of the head.</strong> A vertical nod indicates yes while a horizontal nod means no.

		</li>



	<h2>

		Table Manners

	</h2>



		<li>

			Bring along a <strong>gift</strong> to dinner invitations, but do not get something too expensive.

		</li>



		<li>

			<strong>Eat whatever</strong> has been offered to you, and when the host insists on a second helping say yes otherwise they assume you do not like the food.

		</li>



	<h2>

		Giving and Receiving Gifts

	</h2>



		<li>

			Give gifts with <strong>both hands.</strong> Gifts are not normally opened in the presence of the giver.

		</li>



		<li>

			Gifts from <strong>your country</strong> are appreciated (perfume, chocolates, small china or crystal objects).

		</li>



		<li>

			Gifts <strong>are not normally</strong> expected at the first meeting. Gifts may be given once a relationship develops.

		</li>



	<h2>

		General Do&apos;s and Don&apos;ts

	</h2>



		<li>

			It is traditional to <strong>wear white, not black</strong>, to a funeral in India.

		</li>



		<li>

			Do <strong>not wear shoes/sandals</strong> inside a home.

		</li>



		<li>

			Many Indians find <strong>toilet paper repellent</strong> and consider it cleaner to splash water with the left hand in the appropriate direction. Consequently, <strong>the left hand</strong> is considered unclean and is never used for eating.



		</li>



		<li>

			Do not give <strong>white flowers</strong> as gifts.

		</li>



		<li>

			Do not <strong>point your feet</strong> at people.



		</li>

</ul>
